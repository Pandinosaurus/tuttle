DONE - Move resource in its own module

DONE - Put all the generated files in directory .tuttle (except tuttle_report.html, the entry point of everything accessible from the project)

DONE - should we close stdin ?
	should be tested on *nix

DONE - Tell the user why that resource is deleted :
	- process has changed
	- resource no longer produced
	- ...
	- depends on an invalid resource

Run Functional tests and process states in its own temporary dir

Check that the should-be-created resource really exists at the end of the process, otherwise there have been an issue and any depending process can't pursue
    + Test of a resource not really created by a process should not be invalided when removed

Remove resources that are invalid
Check if some primary resources changed
Check if some resource changed (and invalid them ?)
Check if some resources where deleted and invalidate depending resources

Retrieve duration of common processes from previous workflow

Ensure that a resource that used to be created by the process but is now a primary resource should not be deleted

Stop deleting resources if the time (or % of time) of the work invalidated exceeds a threshold provided by user
    And print invalidation quantity any way

HTTP ou FTP resource

Improve code coverage

Remove #! from modules and packages

Packaging

Travis for tests on *nix. Is it possible to test on Windows ? No

shell processor by default (should tests be run according to the os ?)

Nicer reports : beautiful html, autorelading iframe on the logs

Move default processor to shell

Add a unified log for both stderr and stdout

Produce as much data as you can, similar to option --keep-going in Gnu Make

A working example using tuttle in Github, with continuous integration in Travis CI. Car accidents en France ?
