The best way to discover tuttle is the [main tutorial](tutorial_musketeers/tutorial.md) : counting the importance of each musketeer in the novel
'The Three Musketeers' : python + awk + gnuplot. It explains in deep details how to use tuttle to work smoothly.

Once your familiar with tuttle's workflow, you can find the details of processors and url schemes in the
[tuttlefile reference](reference/tuttlefile_reference.md)

If you're familiar with `make`, the article [Make vs tuttle](http://okfnlabs.org/blog/2016/03/25/make-vs-tuttle.html) on OKFN labs is also a good introduction.
