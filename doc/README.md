The best way to discover tuttle is the [main tutorial](tutorial_musketeers/tutorial.md) : counting the importance of each musketeer in the novel
The Three Musketeers : python + awk + gnuplot. It explains in deep details how to use tuttle to work smoothly.

There is also a demo project which computes the penetration rate of a product using open data for population. This
