# Tutorial


The purpose of this tutorial is to explain, line by line, the [demo project](examples/musketeers) which
scans the the novel *The Three Musketeers*, to measure the importance of each musketeer. From a zip archive,
you will extract the text to produce a
[png bar graph](http://abonnasseau.github.io/tuttle/docs/musketeers_assets/characters_count.png) and
a [csv file](http://abonnasseau.github.io/tuttle/docs/musketeers_assets/characters_count.csv) you can
import in our favorite spreadsheet software.

You need to have `tuttle` [installed](https://github.com/abonnasseau/tuttle/releases) on Linux, with
[gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info/) to run the tutorial. We'll use little python, gnuplot and shell code.

# Unzip the novel

In an empty directory, download the [zip](http://abonnasseau.github.io/tuttle/docs/musketeers_assets/Les_trois_mousquetaires.zip).
Then create a file called ``tuttlefile`` and paste this code :

    file://Les_trois_mousquetaires.txt <- file://Les_trois_mousquetaires.zip
        unzip Les_trois_mousquetaires.zip Les_trois_mousquetaires.txt

On line 1, we tell tuttle that we intend to produce Les_trois_mousquetaires.txt from the file Les_trois_mousquetaires.zip.
How to do that ? With the shell code provided on line 2 : calling online zip utility. Notice the indentation
 that delimits the code.

Let's run this workflow :

```console
lexman@lexman-pc:~$ cd tuttle_tutorial
lexman@lexman-pc:~/tuttle_tutorial$ tuttle run
============================================================
tuttlefile_1
============================================================
--- stdout : -----------------------------------------------
Archive:  Les_trois_mousquetaires.zip
  inflating: Les_trois_mousquetaires.txt

--- stderr : -----------------------------------------------
+ unzip Les_trois_mousquetaires.txt
lexman@lexman-pc:~/tuttle_tutorial$
====
Done
```

`tuttlefile_1` is the identifier of the *process* in the *workflow* : it has been declared one line 1 of file
`tuttlefile`. The execution displays all the outputs of the process.

We have ran our first *workflow*. We can take a look at our workspace :

```console
lexman@lexman-pc:~/tuttle_tutorial$ ls -la
total 1854
drwxrwx--- 1 lexman lexman    4096 mai   25 22:59 .

lexman@lexman-pc:~/tuttle_tutorial$ head Les_trois_mousquetaires.txt
PRÉFACE

dans laquelle il est établi que malgré leurs noms en os et en is, les héros de l'histoire que nous allons avoir l'honneur de raconter à
[...]
capricieux du poète n'est pas toujours ce qui impressionne la masse des lecteurs. Or, tout en admirant, comme les autres les admireront sans doute, les détails que nous avons signalés, la chose qui nous préoccupa le plus est une chose à laquelle bien certainement personne avant nous n'avait fait la moindre attention.
lexman@lexman-pc:~/tuttle_tutorial$
```

Well, the text is in french, but it does look like a novel, as we expected. We have produced our firest *resource* :
the file Les_trois_mousquetaires.txt.

Before we go on, take time to commit your work in your versioning system, eg `git`. You only need to commit the
`tuttlefile` and the *primary resource* Les_trois_mousquetaires.zip. Other *resources* like Les_trois_mousquetaires.txt
are generated by tuttle, so you can always retrieve full history from the sources.

# Count musketeers

Shell won't be enough find the words in the text. We'll use a few lines of python to parse the text and count :

file://characters_count.dat <- file://Les_trois_mousquetaires.txt !# python
    # -*- coding: utf8 -*-
    names = ["Athos", "Porthos", "Aramis", "d'Artagnan"]
    with open('characters_count.dat', 'w') as f_out:
        with open('Les_trois_mousquetaires.txt') as f_in:
            content = f_in.read()
        print("{} chars in the novel".format(len(content)))
        for name in names:
            f_out.write("{}\t{}\n".format(name, content.count(name)))
            print("{} - done".format(name))

At the end of line 1, `! python` tells tuttle to use the python *processor* to run the code of the process.

In a few words, the python code loads all the text from The Three Musketeers in memory, and converts it to lower case
to ease comparison of text. Then for each name of musketeer, it converts it in lower case it counts the occurrences in
the text, in order to write a line in file characters_count.dat.

Let's run it :

```console
lexman@lexman-pc:~/tuttle_tutorial$ tuttle run
============================================================
tuttlefile_4
============================================================
--- stdout : -----------------------------------------------
1389543 chars in the novel
Athos - done
Porthos - done
Aramis - done
d'Artagnan - done
====
Done
lexman@lexman-pc:~/tuttle_tutorial$
```

You will notice tuttle only runs the necessary *processes* : The first process `tuttlefile_1` has already run, so only the
new process `tuttlefile_4` is executed.

Let's have a look at the result :

```console
lexman@lexman-pc:~/tuttle_tutorial$ cat characters_count.dat
Athos	968
Porthos	587
Aramis	523
D'Artagnan	367
lexman@lexman-pc:~/tuttle_tutorial$
```

So we have the figures in a tabular file that gnuplot can understand.

# TODO : generate report again

It's time to take a look at the report. Open the file [`tuttle_report.html`](http://abonnasseau.github.io/tuttle/doc/tutorial_assets/count_musketeers/tuttle_report.html) at the lexman of the workspace : you can see
everything that has happen in our workflow : duration of the processes, whether they have failed, a graph of their
dependencies. You can even download all the logs.


# Export to spreadsheet

We all have this coworker interested in the data we're processing. *So I've heard you're counting the musketeers
 in The Three Musketeers... Would you mind sending me the files so that I could make my own graph in my spreadsheet ?*

Well, it requires no work to mail him the characters_count.dat file. But in fact his favorite spreadsheet software can't
open it : strings should be quoted, and columns needs to be separated by a comma instead of a tabulation... And you must
not omit windows new lines !

A simple line of awk does the trick :

    file://characters_count.csv <- file://characters_count.dat
        awk '{print "\""$1"\","$2"\r"}' characters_count.dat > characters_count.csv

After we've run the workflow, we get exactly what we expected :

    968,"Athos"^M
    587,"Porthos"^M
    523,"Aramis"^M
    367,"D'Artagnan"^M

Now we can mail him the new file, just after we have commited our work !

Adding the generation of this file in our *workflow* (and committing) will prove very usefull for updates, as you will
see later.


# Make the bar graph

Now we have data in a form that gnuplot understands. To make a graph from our data, gnuplot need this kind of program
on the standard input :

    set terminal png
    set output "characters_count.png"
    plot "characters_count.dat" using 2: xtic(1) with histogram

Tuttle does not have a gnuplot processor (... yet ! PR are welcome :), so we'll use the
[here doc](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_document#Unix_shells) syntax to insert it in a standard shell *process* :

    file://characters_count.png <- file://characters_count.dat
        gnuplot <<$script$
        set terminal png
        set output "characters_count.png"
        plot "characters_count.dat" using 2: xtic(1) with histogram
        $script$

After we've ran tuttle, we can see the graph :
![Characters count](http://abonnasseau.github.io/tuttle/docs/musketeers_assets/characters_count.png)

It's time to commit our work once again.


# Fix the maths

But wait ? Have you seen this graph ? Do you truly believe the main character, D'Artagnan is mentioned two or three
times less thant his fellow companions ? There must have been an issue somewhere.

After a few verifications, you'll find that the main character's name can be `D'Artagnan` as well as `d'Artagnan`. In
fact `d'Artagnan` seems to be the correct way to spell it, and `D'Artagnan` is used only at the beginning of a sentence.

The right way to fix this is to change the python code to make it robust to case. You might have already noticed that we
usually don't find bugs as soon as we make them, but afterwards when we use some data previously computed. And
frequently our final users find tiny mistakes.

For this bug, we'll replace the former python process with this one, where all strings are converted to lower case
for comparison :

    file://characters_count.dat <- file://Les_trois_mousquetaires.txt !# python
        # -*- coding: utf8 -*-
        names = ["Athos", "Porthos", "Aramis", "d'Artagnan"]
        with open('characters_count.dat', 'w') as f_out:
            with open('Les_trois_mousquetaires.txt') as f_in:
                content_low = f_in.read().lower()
            print("{} chars in the novel".format(len(content_low)))
            for name in names:
                name_low = name.lower()
                f_out.write("{}\t{}\n".format(name, content_low.count(name_low)))
                print("{} - done".format(name))

Let's see what happens when we run this new process :

```console
lexman@lexman-pc:~/tuttle_tutorial$ tuttle run
The following resources are not valid any more and will be removed :
* file://characters_count.dat - Process code changed
* file://characters_count.png - Resource depends on file://characters_count.dat that have changed
0 seconds of processing will be lost
============================================================
tuttlefile_4
============================================================
--- stdout : -----------------------------------------------
1389543 chars in the novel
Athos - done
Porthos - done
Aramis - done
d'Artagnan - done

============================================================
tuttlefile_16
============================================================
--- stderr : -----------------------------------------------
+ gnuplot

Done
lexman@lexman-pc:~/tuttle_tutorial$
```

Tuttle has noticed the change. Before running the necessary *processes*, it cleans the workspace by deleting all the
*resources* that no longer fit with the current workflow. Of course tuttle explains exactly what is going to be deleted,
and even how much time of former processing will be lost!


# Conclusion
We've seen how to run a process with tuttle. In the incoming tutorial, you will learn how to deal with errors while you
work.
